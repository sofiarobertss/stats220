## This is my repository for STATS 220. 

**A little about me:**

- I am undertaking a degree in *Logic and Computation*
- I am taking STATS 220 for various reasons:
    1. I want to expand my knowledge of data technologies. 
    2. I am interested in learning more about R and expanding my knowledge of different coding 
       languages. 
    3. I enjoy practicing by ability to problem solve in different capacities. 
- I am interested in learning about data technologies and how they work together.
