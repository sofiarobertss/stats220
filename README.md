# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Logic and Computation
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to expand my knowledge on data and learn more programming languages. 
- I am interested in learning about data technologies and how they work together.
